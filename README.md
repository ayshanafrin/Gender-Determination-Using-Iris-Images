# Gender-Determination-Using-Iris-Images
Gender Determination Using Iris Images is a deep learning–based biometric application that predicts a person’s gender from iris patterns. The project leverages image processing and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze unique iris textures, which are known to contain discriminative features between male and female eyes.
